CORE MUD LPC Generator FIles

# Introduction
These generator files currently work with gurbalib as there's no way in hell dave would give me access to COREMUD Source, with good reason.

# License

# core_room.py
this basically generates a room, the exit commands calculate the new room names, you will likely need to tweak the LPC to make it fit cores, let me know if you'd like my help or if you can give me a template room

# core_npc.py
this basically generates an LPC, works for gurbalib and the LPC is syntactically sound, it will need to be modified, please get me a template npc
